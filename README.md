# Speech_Therapy for autistic kids
Autistic children can find it hard to relate to and communicate with other people. They might be slower to develop language, have no language at all, or have significant 
problems with understanding or using spoken language. They might not use gestures to make up for the problems they have with words.

The system aims at providing a method which provides more robust and accurate results with minimum computational cost. The suggested method uses Speech recognition to 
recognize the word and text to speech conversion is used to analyze whether the word pronounced is right or wrong. The system also keeps track of the words not pronounced correctly and gives a detailed analysis at the end.
